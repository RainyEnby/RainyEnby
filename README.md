- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Javascript, as well as some Art skills for game creation and for comissions.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on coding a Pokemon Fangame called Pokemon Ultra Gun, a meme that was suggested by Jaiden Animations on YouTube, me and my sibling thought it would be fun to create the game and came up with a storyline and game mechanics.
